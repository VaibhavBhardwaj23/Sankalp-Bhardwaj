    <h2 id="buisness">What is Buisness Blasters?</h2>
    <p>
      So, first of all lets talk about what buisness blasters is ? It is a
      Delhi government initiative, this programme seeks to
      inculcate a business and entreprenuerial mindset amongst students through
      a specially designed curriculum. It encourages students to become job
      creator rather than job-seekers. In 2021-22 , 300,000+ students of grade
      11 & 12 of 1000+ government schools of Delhi recieved seed funding of
      rupees <span style="color: black;font-weight: bold;">2000</span> each for a
      <strong>buisness idea </strong> that they developed in a team with the
      objective of either earning profit or creating social impact . Most of
      students belong to the most disadvantaged socio-economic communities .
    </p>
    <p>
      It is world's largest startup programme for students . As a part of
      Buisness Blasters program , students work in teams , brainstrom , identify
      buisness opportunities , prepare business plans and implement their

      <li>

        the final round involved showcasing and pitching the projects in an
        investment summit , to the companies and entrepreneurs , potential

        incubators , universities , etc . A large stadium was booked for
        exhibiting the buisnesses and providing an opportunity for the investors
        to meet and talk to the selected teams . With the live coverage on radio
        and television channels , the expo not only provided a platform for the
        teams to explore oppotrtunities for collaborations , investments , and
        buisness partnerships with the interested visitors in the event , but it
        also created a lot of enthusiasm among the parents and their children
        for entrepreneurship.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="Qala"style="font-size: 6.9em;
    text-align: center;"><em>Qala</em></h1>
    <p>
      <em> Qala </em> is my buisness plan which I am going to work on . So lets
      first decode what <em> Qala </em> is . Qala means art , a form which one have in their hands .As we all know that there are a lot of programs initiated by the government of India to empower women , for example - 
      <ul> 
        <li><strong> Beti Bachao Beti Padhao :</strong> This sceheme ensures survival , protection and education of girl children . </li>
        <li><strong> Mahila Shakti Kendra :</strong> It is a centerally sponsored scheme to empower rural women through community participation . </li>
        <li> <strong> Annapurna:</strong> In this scheme loan is provided to women in the food actering industry , still establishing their small-scale buisnesses .</li>

      </ul>
      and many more schemes . So Qala is yet another business/ scheme which will aim towards the homemakers , "<em> The Housewives </em>" . Our aim is to give employment to those women who have some kind of Qala in their hand but never got the price that it deserves . In today's world competition is very high and for getting job or for earning money one need high educational qualification , but a lot of housewives don't have such high qualification because they came from a time where women were not meant to go to school, they were taught to stay at home and do homechores . But now time has changed and women have the right to get educate and do whatever they want . Now is the time that these women should also get employment not on the basis of their education but on the basis of the skills they have .The time when they were not meant to study or go out , they learned some skills to pass their time , like <em> embroidery , knitting , crocheting </em> and many more . Till this time they do all these things just for timepass cause they are not even aware of the thing that they can earn from that . Today's generation is more toward the tech and mechanic world , and these art are somehow getting lost because there is no one to learn it and take it further . This is one of our motive too to promote these skills so people get to know about it , so that they can evolve curiosity to learn these skills .  
    </p>
    <p> One of the example is my own mother , she have the skill of knitting and crocheting . She makes sweaters , cardigans , caps , socks and many more things , but what she gets in return ? nothing , no price for her hardwork and time . She always wants to work ,but never got out to work . She used to work but after her marriage she left it and now she have that thing in her that she wants to work . She gets offers like  caretaking and work like that , but they are all 24 hour work and that's why she don't accept the work . After seeing her I thought of thousands of women out there who have that thing in them to work but are not able to because of family , educational barrier or some other reasons. These women wants to work , they want to earn , some money which they can say are only theirs .That's when I thought of creating Qala a buisness in which they will provide us there creations and we will become the bridge between them and the customers .So that they don't need to ask for money from someone again, so that they can buy anything they want without asking for money . Like this they didn't even need to leave there house or family and don't even need any educational background . All they need is a <em>Qala</em>.    </p>
    <h2>How will it be profitable for us ?</h2>
    <p> It's a simple thing what they gave us we will sell and the profit/money we will get , will be divided between us and them . From the 100% profit we will take 8% and rest of 92% will be given to them for their hardwork and time . One more thing is that its a never ending business , the women will create and we will sell . time by time more n more women will join and our business will eventually expand .</p>
    <h2 id="target">Target</h2>
    <p> My target is to make housewives self employed and stop the old skills from getting vanished . The aim is to make handmade skills more n more popular . The main skill on which our buisness will be on is crocheting and knitting . The question is how will we going to make this buisness work ? The answer is by promoting it more n more by steps like -</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>By spreading<strong> pamplets </strong>about our buisness.</li>
        <li>By meeting household women personally</li>
        <li> <strong>Social Media</strong> is the biggest platform right now to promote your buisness</li>
        <li>We can organise our <strong>stalls</strong> once in a month or week </li>
        <li><strong>Paid promotion </strong> through radio or newspaper</li>
    </ul>
    So these are the steps that we are going to take to promote and expand our buisness.
